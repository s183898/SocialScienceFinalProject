Furious, Joffrey proclaims that he was punishing her. Denouncing his nephew as a ""halfwit,"" Tyrion points out the absurdity of punishing Sansa for her brother\'s actions miles away in a war that Joffrey himself started.

He asks her whether she wants to end her engagement to the king, but she continues to parrot the lines that she loves Joffrey and will uphold her duty. Impressed, Tyrion remarks that she has learned how to survive around Joffrey and might just make it out of her situation alive, respectfully calling her ""Lady Stark.""\n', ""Bronn suggests to Tyrion that as an angry young man, maybe what Joffrey needs is to have sex with a woman, and that they should set him up with a prostitute. Tyrion agrees that maybe this would give Joffrey a chance to release his frustrations away from Sansa. Indeed, he might even be grateful for the gesture: given that he didn't have much of a father figure in Robert Baratheon to set him straight, doing something nice for the boy might even be the second chance Joffrey needs to re-establish a relationship with a male family figure. So Tyrion arranges for two prostitutes from Littlefinger's brothel, Ros and Daisy, to entertain Joffrey. Unfortunately, the attempt fails horrifically: instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes, Joffrey brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber. At crossbow-point, Joffrey forces Ros to beat Daisy unconscious, and then to dump her body in Tyrion's chambers, to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of Sansa again.\n"", 'As Tyrion works in his chamber late at night, his cousin Lancel Lannister knocks on his door delivering orders from Cersei to release Grand Maester Pycelle from the dungeon at once. Despite their blood relationship Lancel clearly holds Tyrion in contempt and openly calls him ""Imp."" Curious, Tyrion asks why Lancel is so late delivering the message. Blundering into a rather obvious trap, Lancel retorts that he always delivers messages immediately and is never late. Tyrion then simply points out how odd it is that Lancel would be coming from Cersei\'s bedchambers in the middle of the night. Lancel nervously says Cersei often works tirelessly keeping late hours, but Tyrion also notices that he reeks of Cersei\'s favorite lavender oil perfume. Tyrion enquires whether Lancel was made a knight before or after he started sharing Cersei\'s bed. Lancel falls apart, saying that Cersei\'s father ordered him to obey her every command when he became a squire to King Robert. Tyrion sarcastically asks if Cersei forced him to have sex with her too. Tyrion wonders aloud what Joffrey would do if he found out that Lancel had not only killed Joffrey\'s father but was also sleeping with his mother. Lancel gets down on his knees and pleads for his life. Tyrion gently instructs Lancel that he won\'t tell, but from now on, Lancel must report everything Cersei does back to Tyrion. As Lancel leaves, he also casually agrees that he will accede to Cersei\'s request and free Pycelle if she wants him as a ""pet"", though he doesn\'t want him back on the Small Council.\n']"

Stannis counters that it is odd that Catelyn is standing alongside Renly, given that her own husband Ned Stark rejected Renly\'s initial plan to claim the throne and supported Stannis as Robert\'s rightful heir, even at the cost of his own life. In a display of leniency that is uncharacteristic for him, Stannis offers Renly that if he relinquishes his claim, Stannis will grant him his old seat on the small council, and even name him as his heir (unless Stannis ever has a son in the future). Catelyn reminds Stannis that their common enemy is the Lannisters, but he will not hear it, again asserting his right to the Iron Throne.

For that matter, despite all evidence to the contrary, Tywin refuses to believe that Tyrion was in any way helpful in the defense of the city or during his months as acting Hand of the King.

Tywin is particularly insulted that Tyrion brought his mistress, Shae, to the capital when Tywin explicitly told him not to, which makes Tywin convince himself that Tyrion was in bed with Shae most of the time while events spiraled out of control. When Tyrion asks why his father is doing this, Tywin is shocked as if Tyrion insulted him, and says it should be obvious as Tyrion ""killed"" his mother Joanna in childbirth so that he might enter the world. Tywin says that the laws of men say he has to let Tyrion use his family name, but that he wishes he could prove Tyrion wasn\'t his son, so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name ""Lannister"" which he stole from Tywin.

Edmure's role in this was to offer token defense as a feint to lure the Lannisters back west across the Red Fork of the Trident. Instead, by successfully attacking the Lannisters at Stone Mill, Edmure kept them penned in the Riverlands, and thus close enough to King's Landing that Tywin was able to rush to the defense of the city at the Battle of the Blackwater. The Starks' strategic position in the war has been ruined. Edmure insists that they took valuable captives in the battle, Willem and Martyn Lannister, but Robb angrily points out that he didn't stop fighting because his sisters are held captive.

Bronn asks if he thinks Littlefinger has been stealing to obtain the crown's money, but Tyrion says the problem is more that he's been borrowing all of it. Littlefinger always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise money seemingly out of nowhere, but in reality the Iron Throne is heavily in debt, and Littlefinger procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from foreign banks. \n"", ""Tyrion is fascinated at Pod's ability to pleasure women."", 'In particular, much of their debt is owed to the Iron Bank of Braavos, the largest bank in the Free Cities.

Tywin makes it clear that he considers Jaime his heir - despite the fact that as a Kingsguard member, Jaime has officially renounced all rights to inheritance. Tyrion previously noted that he is next in line of succession after Jaime, as a younger son inherits before an older daughter, but Tywin said he would never let his hated dwarf son be his heir. Cersei points out that (as she is next in line of succession) maybe Tywin should consider her the real heir to his legacy, not his sons. She claims she is the only one of his children who ever took his lectures on family and legacy seriously. She points out that for a man who pays a lot of lip service to ""family"" and ""legacy,"" he excludes her from his plans. Tywin confirms that he excludes Cersei from his plans, but not because she is a woman: he distrusts her because she isn\'t nearly as smart as she thinks she is. He sneers that she has allowed Joffrey to run roughshod over her, the city and its people, and that he intends to rein in his grandson\'s deranged behavior. Cersei says she is afraid of the growing influence of the Tyrells at court, and something must be done about them. In particular, Cersei is nervous about how skilled Margaery Tyrell is at manipulating Joffrey. Tywin bluntly responds that it\'s good someone has finally been able to manipulate Joffrey, as Cersei herself has clearly proven to be incapable of doing it. She says Tywin should try stopping Joffrey from doing what he likes (implying he will find it extremely difficult), but her father firmly responds, ""I will.""\n', 'Varys and Olenna discuss Sansa', 'Meanwhile, Olenna is seated in the gardens with two of Margaery\'s cousins. One of them embroiders a golden Tyrell rose with their motto, ""Growing Strong,"" which prompts Olenna to complain that their family has the dullest sigil and motto in the Seven Kingdoms. Other families have interesting mottos like ""Winter Is Coming"" or ""We Do Not Sow,"" and have direwolves and krakens for sigils. Varys arrives to meet with Olenna and she shoos the girls away. They walk through the gardens, and while Olenna remains relatively polite she instantly sees through all of Varys\' pleasantries. Varys is verbally outmatched, for once, and she asks him to just get to the point. He says that he is extremely worried that Littlefinger is going to try to take control of Sansa Stark: with Robb Stark\'s younger brothers presumed dead at Winterfell, and Arya Stark missing and presumed dead for over a year, Sansa is Robb\'s only heir. The War of the Five Kings is not going well for the Starks now, and if Robb were to be defeated and die, the man who controls Sansa controls the North. Varys says that while he enjoys sparring with Baelish, he is truly horrified by the man. While they are all engaged in the intrigues and murders of court politics, Baelish has utterly no limits on what he will do to achieve power: he would burn the entire realm down if it meant he could be king of the ashes. Olenna agrees and says that the solution is rather obvious.\n', ""Shortly thereafter, Margaery Tyrell finds Sansa Stark praying in the Red Keep's godswood, overlooking Blackwater Bay. She dismisses the Lannister guards (threatening to tell the king they refused her if they don't leave) and engages in pleasant small-talk. Margaery plays a small joke on Sansa by saying that her cousin died of a pox which made her face melt off, but is just trying to brighten her spirits (though in the process is reminded that Sansa is still somewhat naïve). Margaery then invites Sansa to visit Highgarden in the Reach someday. Sansa is confused, as Queen Cersei won't allow her to leave the city, but Margaery wryly points out that Queen Regent Cersei might not want her to, but Queen Margaery would be happy to share Highgarden's pageantry with a friend... or a sister. Margaery points out that if Sansa were to marry Loras, then she would belong in Highgarden anyway. The thought of finally escaping Joffrey, being wed to her idol and becoming a Tyrell makes Sansa choke out tears of joy.\n""]"

They are walking through the woods and see the Three-Eyed Raven again. Jojen advises Bran that he must follow the raven, and when he is confused, Jojen points out that he must follow it by climbing a tree. Bran begins to climb the tree that the raven has landed in but he soon becomes terrified, remembering the fall that crippled him when he was climbing a tower at Winterfell. He sees a vivid dream-memory of his mother Catelyn, repeating her warning in which she made him promise never to climb again - a promise which he broke, and thus indirectly led to the fall which crippled him. Bran is so terrified of the memory of Catelyn yelling at him that he falls off the tree. Bran and Jojen wake in their camp in the woods, disappointed that he could not follow the Three-Eyed Raven.\n', ""Elsewhere, apparently in the North, Theon Greyjoy is being led by the boy who set him free from the dungeon and then rescued him by killing his captors when they tried to recapture him. He says that he is leading Theon to Deepwood Motte, a castle on the west coast of the North which was captured by his sister Yara. He says he is concerned that some of the guards may betray Theon, so it is best to sneak into the castle through the drains until they reach his sister in person. As the boy fumbles around with keys at a locked gate, Theon sinks to the ground and asks if his father Balon knows he was taken captive; the boy says he doesn't know but Theon says he probably did but left him for dead. Filled with remorse, Theon laments that his real father died when his head was cut off in King's Landing, that he had a choice between two families, and he chose wrong. Theon says that now, he has destroyed everything he ever cared about, and his real home Winterfell is burned to the ground. He also says the only thing he ever resented about Robb Stark is that Robb could effortlessly be the kind of good man that Theon truly wanted to be but had to struggle against his own failings to be like. Theon even apologizes aloud for having two innocent orphan boys killed, so in desperation he could pass them off as Bran and Rickon Stark. The boy is surprised, and Theon explains to him that Bran and Rickon escaped, so he had to fake their deaths so he wouldn't seem weak.\n"", 'The boy leads Theon into a dark chamber in the castle, and he calls out for Yara. The boy then lights a torch... revealing the same X-shaped cross that Theon was chained to when he was being tortured before. Theon was led in a complete circle, back to the very same dungeon he ""escaped"" from in the first place. Other guards come in and the boy shouts to tie Theon up again, where he belongs, and that it was Theon who killed the other guards when he tried to escape (instead of him). The boy, giving commands, is revealed to be one of the head torturers, and Theon\'s entire ""escape"" that he led him on was nothing more than another form of torture, sadistically toying with him.\n']"

He asks her if she\'s decided on a name, but she responds that there\'s no point in naming her baby if he\'s only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice. She gives Sam back his mother\'s thimble and says she doesn\'t care about such stupid things, all she\'s focused on is protecting the life of her baby.\n', 'Some of their wounded have died from their injuries, and Lord Commander Jeor Mormont leads a funeral service as they burn the corpse of a man named Bannen on a pyre.

He flings the dying Craster to the ground, then punches one of Craster\'s wives who is present, demanding to know where the hidden food is kept.

Daenerys lets her dragon out of its cage, and leads it on a long chain leash attached to its foot as it hovers about twenty feet in the air. She hands the leash to Kraznys, and in return he gives her a cat-o-nine-tails with a hilt shaped like a Harpy, signifying ownership of the Unsullied.

She smiles slightly, knowing they are now hers. Too distracted to notice, Kraznys complains for Missandei to tell ""the bitch"" that the dragon won\'t come when he commands. Daenerys turns to face Kraznys and bluntly says ""A dragon is not a slave,"" again in perfectly-accented Valyrian. When a dumbfounded Kraznys demands an explanation, she declares that she is Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria: Valyrian is her mother-tongue indicating she\'d been feigning ignorance the entire time (and putting up with Kraznys\' insulting comments) to lull them into a false sense of security.\n', 'Drogon burns Kraznys', 'The Unsullied sack Astapor.', 'Daenerys then addresses the thousands of Unsullied, and orders them to kill all of the slave masters in Astapor, along with all of their household soldiers and any man who holds a whip.

Orell has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the Wall and he wants to know how frequent they are. Jon says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four, two builders to inspect for structural damage and two rangers to protect them, but that the frequency of their patrols often changes.

Jon finds this very unpleasant, but reluctantly says that only three are currently manned. Apart from Castle Black (which even the wildlings know is manned), there is also Eastwatch-by-the-Sea at the extreme eastern end, and the Shadow Tower at the western end. Jon is then asked how many men currently garrison Castle Black. Jon is very reluctant to answer, but after being threatened by Orell, he gives an exaggerated number, saying there are one thousand men (this is a lie, as Castle Black only had six hundred men before the Great Ranging, and the garrison now is closer to three hundred).

Jorah then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the small council, if any of them spoke against Robert when he wanted Daenerys, the last Targaryen, assassinated. It becomes apparent that Jorah is trying to figure out if Barristan knew that Jorah was initially a spy for King Robert, reporting back to Varys. Jorah's report that Daenerys was pregnant is what made Robert demand that Daenerys be assassinated at a small council meeting with Ned Stark. Jorah points out that the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally holds a seat on the small council. However, Barristan explains that as a former Kingsguard member under Aerys Targaryen, and one who'd killed several of Robert's friends, while Robert didn't mind keeping him in his position as a guard, he never really trusted his advice, so he left him out of small council meetings. Jorah is relieved that Barristan was therefore not present at any council meeting so he couldn't have learned that Jorah was sending it reports on Daenerys.

Rickard explains that he was denied his vengeance when Robb\'s mother Catelyn set Jaime free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in King\'s Landing. Finally having enough, Karstark did the next best thing, and killed Jaime\'s kin who they held prisoner. Robb angrily shouts that they were only little boys, and Karstark can\'t blame Catelyn for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war. Karstark stands firm, and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go, when in war they should be killing them. He insults Robb by asking him if his father ever taught him that. Brynden Tully punches Karstark over this remark, but Robb tells him to leave Karstark alone.

Rickard says it isn't meant to stop Robb: he wants it to haunt Robb until the day he dies. With his last words, Lord Rickard says that Robb will be cursed as a kinslayer and that Robb is no king of his. Obedient to the laws of his father Eddard Stark who said that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword, Robb pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads Lord Rickard.\n"", 'Robb\'s strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would: the Karstarks withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for home. This results in Robb losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at Riverrun. Robb openly admits to Talisa that she was right, and he made a mistake. Robb says Tywin Lannister realizes that he\'s in such a strong position he doesn\'t even need to attack the Northerners anymore, he just needs to wait, and let their demoralized forces unravel. When the war began Robb\'s army was unified around a central purpose, but now they have lost momentum, and his generals are acting like bickering children. Robb shows Talisa a war map of the Seven Kingdoms which depict Robb\'s armies concentrated around Riverrun and Harrenhal, Lannister and Tyrell armies overrunning the Stormlands, Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in King\'s Landing, and Greyjoy forces occupying the western coasts of the North. Talisa suggests that he try to take the fight to the Lannisters if they won\'t come to him, but he explains that this is hopeless. Taking King\'s Landing would have been difficult to begin with, but now Tywin and the bulk of the main Lannister army, as well as a large Tyrell army, are defending the city. Attacking the capital head-on would be suicide, and Tywin would crush them within a day. Talisa suggests that he lead his army back to the North to repulse the Greyjoys from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase. Robb points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back home, they won\'t want to leave again, particularly because ""winter is coming,"" and the coming one is expected to be very long, five years or more. The Northerners have been away from their farms fighting in the war, however, so they haven\'t even begun to collect harvests to set aside as winter stockpiles. Thus if Robb returns to the North, it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the Riverlords who declared for him. Eyeing the map with Talisa, Robb decides that if King\'s Landing is too strong to attack and he can\'t return home, his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest. Robb decides that with the main Lannister army-group under Tywin now positioned all the way to the east in King\'s Landing, he needs to return to the Westerlands and make an all-or-nothing assault against Casterly Rock. This will make the Lannisters lose face, just as Robb did when he lost his home castle of Winterfell, and bring momentum back to his army. However, with the loss of the Karstark forces, they don\'t currently have enough men to consider attacking Casterly Rock. The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if Robb can win back the allegiance of House Frey, whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from Robb\'s army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying Talisa, a political nobody, instead of one of the Lord Walder Frey\'s daughters.

Bolton toys with Jaime but remains completely calm, never even grinning, before finally revealing that his sister Cersei is alive and well, and his father\'s forces successfully repulsed Stannis\'s assault. Jaime is so overcome by delirium and relief that his family is safe that he collapses. Bolton calls for Qyburn to attend to Jaime\'s injuries. Later, Qyburn peels away the crude tourniquet that Locke\'s men applied to Jaime, and finds that the stump of his right hand has become badly infected. Jaime asks if he will die, and Qyburn says he won\'t, but the corruption has spread to the point that it would be safest just to amputate the rest of his right arm at the shoulder. Half-delirious from the infection, Jaime refuses, and says he\'ll kill Qyburn if he tries. Jaime then notices that Qyburn is not a Maester, because he isn\'t wearing a maester\'s chain of office. Qyburn acknowledges this, explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the Citadel and thrown out of the Order of Maesters, because as he says, he was conducting experiments which they felt were ""too bold."" Qyburn gets ready to cut Jaime, and says he\'ll at least try to save his elbow, but with a sudden burst of effort Jaime grabs him around the throat with his left hand, and says he doesn\'t need his right hand to kill him. Qyburn relents, and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten, then burning out the wounds with boiling wine, and with luck this might be able to stop the infection without having to amputate more of Jaime\'s arm above the wrist. Jaime says he\'s willing to try this, but Qyburn cautions that it will cause a great amount of pain so he needs to give him Milk of the Poppy, but Jaime refuses to take it, and says he\'ll just scream. Qyburn cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain, but Jaime says that he will just scream loudly. Qyburn begins to dig into the stump of Jaime\'s arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue, and Jaime howls in agony.\n', 'Some time later, Brienne is in Harrenhal\'s bathhouse, scrubbing off weeks\' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the Riverlands. Jaime then appears in the doorway assisted by a servant, barely able to stand due to the pain he is in. He asks the servant to help him take off his muddy rags and leave. Jaime then walks naked into the same communal bath that Brienne is in, on the far side. She is also naked and angrily points out that there are other baths, but he says he wants this one; he\'s afraid he\'s going to pass out at any moment, and wants her to save him from drowning if he does, because he doesn\'t want to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub. Brienne asks why she should care how he dies, but he points out that she swore a solemn vow to get him to King\'s Landing in one piece - which (indicating the stump of his hand) has not been going so well. Jaime quips that it\'s no wonder Renly died with Brienne guarding him, at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath, facing him fully nude, to show him she isn\'t afraid of him. Jaime gravely says that was ""unworthy"" and asks for forgiveness, Brienne angrily orders him not to mock her, but he insists he\'s seriously apologizing. Exhausted, Jaime says he\'s tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce; Brienne says you need trust to have a truce, but he says he trusts her, so she sits back down.\n', ""Jaime recounts Aerys's madness."", 'Jaime then notes that Brienne has the same look on her face that he\'s seen on countless faces in the past seventeen years: people that despise him, call him ""kingslayer"" more than his own name, or ""oathbreaker"" and ""a man without honor."" Jaime then goes on to recall the Mad King\'s\xa0obsession with wildfire, how Aerys enjoyed watching people being burned alive. Jaime recalls Aerys burned lords he didn\'t like, Hands\xa0who failed him, and anyone he thought was against him. Ultimately, half of Westeros rebelled against him, so Aerys had his pyromancers place caches of wildfire all over King\'s Landing: under the Great Sept of Baelor, under the slums of Flea Bottom, under houses, stables, taverns, and even under the Red Keep itself. After Robert\'s\xa0victory at the Trident he marched on the capital city, but Jaime\'s father Tywin arrived there first, leading the entire Lannister army, and promising to defend the city. Jaime warned Aerys that his father was never a man to choose the losing side, that this must be a trick and he should surrender the city while he still could, but the Mad King refused to listen. Nor did Aerys listen to Varys when he gave the same warning that Tywin couldn\'t be trusted - but he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, who convinced Aerys the Lannisters were there to help. Aerys opened the city gates, and the Lannisters proceeded to sack the city.\xa0Jaime again begged Aerys to surrender, but the Mad King ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin\'s head, and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze, burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire. Jaime makes it plain to Brienne that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious Renly commanded her to kill her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people; she can only sit in shocked silence. Jaime goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer first, then drove his sword into Aerys\'s back as the Mad King tried to run for his life. Shaken at the memory, Jaime speculates that King Aerys didn\'t believe he would die in the blaze; in his lunacy, the Mad King believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the fire, granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes... so Jaime finished Aerys off by slitting his throat in order to\xa0make sure he died, concluding that\xa0Eddard Stark\xa0found him at that point.\nStunned, Brienne asks why Jaime didn\'t defend himself with this account before. Jaime angrily rants that the ""honorable"" Lord Stark would never have believed a word he said: Stark didn\'t want to hear Jaime\'s side of the story when he\'d already judged him guilty.\n', 'Jaime faints.', 'Jaime goes on to rage, yelling what right Stark had to judge him, by what right the wolf dares to judge the lion. The strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes Jaime, however, and he begins to faint, nearly falling face-first into the water. Brienne catches him and calls for help for the Kingslayer, at which (as he slips out of consciousness) he whimpers to himself ""Jaime. My name is Jaime...""\n', 'The Hound vs Beric.', ""Elsewhere in the Riverlands, at the hideout of the Brotherhood Without Banners in Hollow Hill, Sandor Clegane prepares to fight Beric Dondarrion in a trial by combat. As both men prepare, Thoros of Myr prays to the Lord of Light to judge Sandor for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent. Before the fight begins, Beric calls upon the Lord of Light to ignite his sword with flame, using only his blood. Due to the Sandor's fear of fire, Beric initially has an advantage against the Hound. Beric even manages to set Sandor's wooden shield on fire, which is strapped so tightly to Sandor's arm that he cannot remove it and is nearly burned himself. Eventually, however, Sandor's raw physical strength and anger (born of terror) overpowers Beric, and with a single downward swipe, cuts right through his flaming sword, his armor, and deep into his shoulder, killing him.\n"", 'Thoros reviving Beric.', ""As Beric falls to the ground,\xa0Thoros quickly rushes to his side, and begins praying to the Lord of Light to revive him. Sandor falls to the ground to desperately try and extinguish his flaming shield. Arya Stark grabs a dagger and attempts to kill the Hound while he is down, but she is stopped by Gendry. As she curses him, Sandor taunts Arya over how the god prefers him over her dead friend, however they are both interrupted by Beric, who has been revived by the Lord of Light's power. Having won the trial, and proven his innocence in the eyes of god, Sandor is allowed to leave. The Brotherhood had taken all of the gold Sandor had on him (to fund their cause), and in lieu of returning it, Beric gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the end of the war. Sandor scoffs at this and throws it to the ground, but Anguy says he should be thankful they're letting him leave with his life. Clegane is hooded so he won't know the way back to their hideout, then led away to be released some distance away.\n"", 'After the fight, Gendry works on repairing Beric\'s armor, and Arya questions why, because they will be leaving soon. Gendry says that he has decided to stay and work as a smith for the Brotherhood Without Banners, to aid them in their cause to protect the smallfolk during the war. Arya says that their plan was to find her brother Robb, and Robb needs soldiers too, but Gendry points out that he has no attachments to Robb Stark: Arya would be going to her noble-born family, and he\'d just be serving another lord. Gendry says he\'s been serving other men his whole life and he has nothing to show for it: he worked most of his life for Tobho Mott and he repaid Gendry by selling him to the Night\'s Watch (as soon as the secret payments from Varys ended), and he ""served"" Tywin Lannister as a prisoner at Harrenhal, every day afraid he\'d be killed or tortured. He\'d be serving in the Brotherhood too, but they chose Beric as their leader, and they\'re more like a family - and as a common-born tavern maiden\'s son who was orphaned at a young age, Gendry has never had a family. Arya sadly chokes out that she could be his family. In response, Gendry politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her, they\'d never be family: he\'d still be a commoner, and she\'d be ""m\'lady.""\n', 'Later that night, Arya looks into the campfire and recites her nightly prayer-list for the death of her enemies. Thoros says that they plan to bring her to Riverrun to reunite her with her family, and in exchange for a reward from Robb to fund their cause. Arya points out that they are ransoming her, and Thoros admits they technically are, but this is different. They do intend to escort her safely through the war-ravaged countryside to her family, and Beric would like to return her for free out of memory of her father, but they really need the gold to support themselves. Beric says he knows she must be angry with him, but releasing Sandor was the right thing to do, as they\'d promised to let him go free if he won the trial by combat. Arya is still quietly upset, as she\'s now seen many honorable men keep their promises and behave lawfully only to be killed for it (such as Yoren and her own father). She wonders why Beric would want to let Sandor go when he nearly killed him, but Beric insists that he did actually kill him. When Arya asks how, Beric points her to Thoros to explain, but he says that he isn\'t the one who brings Beric back to life, it\'s the Lord of Light, and Thoros is just the ""lucky drunk"" who recites the prayers. Beric opens his shirt to reveal several grievous scars on his torso: they explain that Beric has actually died and then been brought back to life six times now, counting his recent death in the trial by combat. He has been impaled on a lance, shot with an arrow, and at his fifth death the Lannisters hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye (which didn\'t heal when Thoros brought him back). Arya earnestly asks Thoros if he could bring back to life a man without a head. Thoros and Beric both understand that she is asking about bringing back her father, but Thoros says he doesn\'t think it works that way (both because he was decapitated, and because he\'s been dead for far too long by now). Beric consoles her that her father was a good man, but he wouldn\'t wish his resurrected life on him. Beric explains that being brought back from the dead carries a heavy toll, as pieces of his memory and who he was before chip away each time. Arya still says she would wish Beric\'s life on her father, because at least Beric is still alive.\n']"
143,season3,Kissed_by_Fire,At Dragonstone,"['At Dragonstone, King Stannis Baratheon is still deeply depressed after his defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, and doesn\'t have the daily support of the Red Priestess Melisandre since she left on what she claimed was an important mission. Most of Stannis\' army has been destroyed, and the only reason the Lannisters haven\'t attacked Dragonstone yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at Blackwater that they cannot yet mount an amphibious assault. With little else to do, Stannis takes the time to visit his wife, Queen Selyse (who was born into House Florent), for the first time since returning from the battle. He finds her in her chamber, praying over a fire to the Lord of Light: Selyse is a fanatical believer in the Lord of Light religion, far more so than Stannis, and it was indeed Selyse who first invited Melisandre to Dragonstone. Stannis and Selyse do not have a loving relationship, but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the Lord\'s Chosen. She tells him not to despair despite his defeat, and he will be victorious, but he laments that he used to believe that once. Due to his extreme belief in duty, (unlike his hedonistic brother Robert) Stannis is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to Selyse, when he had sex with Melisandre to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly. He begins to confess to Selyse that he has sinned and shamed her, but she interrupts him and says Melisandre already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the Lord of Light can be a sin. Indeed, she wept for joy when Melisandre told her of this service she did for the Lord of Light with Stannis, and because the Red Priestess gave him a ""son"" (of sorts) which she never could. Stannis\' face is filled with a mix of shock, disgust, and relief. Selyse had three sons with Stannis but they were all stillborn, and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars. The deaths of her ""sweet boys"" and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected Selyse, and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the Lord of Light. She weeps, and laments that she has given Stannis nothing - he does not blame her, and with pity he says that\'s not true. Selyse understands he is referring to their daughter and only child, Princess Shireen Baratheon. She grows annoyed when she realizes he\'s come to see her too, and says he shouldn\'t waste time on such distractions, but insists that she is his daughter, and she relents because it is not her place to question her king.\n', 'Shireen visits Davos while in the dungeons.', 'Shireen is alone in her room drawing and singing a song about life under the sea to herself, and is excited to see her father. She is a cheerful but sickly young girl (about the same age as Arya Stark), with the left side of her face badly scarred and disfigured by the dreaded Greyscale disease. Stannis wanted to see his daughter, but he is awkward in expressing warm emotions to her. She says she heard he was in a battle and asks if he won, and he good-naturedly says no. Shireen is slightly let-down, but asks if the Onion Knight came back as well: Ser Davos Seaworth has been her friend during his service to her father, and he even made her a toy ship. Growing tense over their falling out, Stannis briefly explains that Ser Davos is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon. Confused, he flatly says she should best put him out of her mind.\n', 'Later that night, Shireen sneaks down to the dungeon of Dragonstone and finds the cell of ""Ser Onion Knight."" He wakes up and tells her she shouldn\'t be there, but she explains that the fat guard Bert is on duty, who usually drinks a lot of wine and sleeps through his watch. She asks if it is true that he is a traitor, and he says that it is, as he disobeyed her father. She says she doesn\'t care, he\'s her friend. She was worried that he must get bored down in his cell, so she brought him a book to read, about Aegon the Conquer and his dragons - she excitedly points out that the Targaryens built Dragonstone, and Aegon used to live in this very castle. Davos reluctantly explains that it\'s wasted on him, because he doesn\'t know how to read. Undaunted, Shireen offers to teach him how to read, by coming down to his cell and reading to him when Bert is on duty. Davos chides her that they can\'t, but she asks what\'s the worst the guards could do to them if they find out, lock them in cells? They have a quiet laugh, and Shireen starts to read to Davos An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.\n']"

Tyrion questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match, but Tywin points out that as a plot against them, the Tyrells\' plan is, by definition, a secret, thus the Lannisters can\'t be said to be ""refusing"" them something which they aren\'t officially trying to do.

A full retreat into the castle is ordered, and Grey Worm commands the Unsullied to form up a rearguard to protect the withdrawal of their few remaining forces. Samwell Tarly is nearly killed in the retreat, but Dolorous Edd saves him - only to be stabbed from behind and killed. The wights gradually slaughter their way forward, even as new Unsullied step forward to take the place of each the falls.\n', 'The Unsullied are on the verge of being overwhelmed, when the last of the main host gets back through the gates.

Attempts by Arya and the other archers to shoot the pitch with flaming arrows are blown away by severe winds while the snowstorm prevents the dragonriders from seeing their signal to light it. Melisandre appears, laying\xa0her hands on the trenchworks and repeats her prayers to the Lord of Light, straining with the massive effort. At the last moment, the entire trench ringing Winterfell bursts into flames. Grey Worm and his few remaining men withdraw behind the castle gates, which close. Many wights burn, but then they all robotically halt - instead of mindlessly charging ahead to their destruction. The White Walkers can afford to wait them out.\n']"

Gendry humbly responds that he didn\'t even know that Robert was his father until after he died. Daenerys then asks him who the Lord of Storm\'s End is now that Robert is dead: he says he doesn\'t know, then she asks the entire hall, rhetorically, who the lord of Storm\'s End is now (with both of Robert\'s brothers, Stannis and Renly, also dead). Daenerys declares that she will make Gendry the new Lord of Storm\'s End, as a reward for his heroism. Gendry is shocked, and says he cannot be, as he is only Robert\'s bastard son. Daenerys quickly addresses this by announcing that in her power as queen, she legitimizes him as ""Gendry Baratheon"", rightful son of Robert - nominally the new lord of Storm\'s End and head of a revived House Baratheon. Davos Seaworth, from the Stormlands, toasts the newly made Gendry Baratheon, followed by the rest of the hall. Quietly at the main table, however, Tyrion notes to Daenerys - with approval - that this wasn\'t an altogether altruistic move, but politically wise: this props up Gendry as a rival claimant to rule of the Stormlands instead of Cersei, while at the same time pacifying what could have been a rival claimant to the Iron Throne by making him dependent on her favor.

Davos wonders what this all means: he hated Melisandre, but she had a real connection to some sort of higher power - which she called the ""Lord of Light"", but whatever it was, their last connection to it ended with her. Why, he wonders, would this divine power directly intervene in their affairs - only to then leave them after the great danger passed?

He says he heard that she was taken by Littlefinger. After that, Sandor comments that she was ""broken in rough"" - marrying Ramsay Bolton, who raped and imprisoned her. Sansa says that without Littlefinger and the rest, she\'d have just stayed a ""little bird"" her whole life, but the abuse she suffered from Ramsay\xa0made her strong.

Grimly noting that oblivion is the best he could hope for, Tyrion goes over his past sins, including murdering his lover and father and betraying their queen.

Jon is disturbed by what Daenerys did and is unable to justify it, but believes the war is over now. Tyrion questions Jon, ""Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who\'s done fighting?"" He goes on to say, ""She liberated the people of Slaver\'s Bay. She \'liberated\' the people of King\'s Landing. And she\'ll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all"". Jon angrily responds that Tyrion has been counseling her, and Tyrion agrees, ""Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen\'s nature is fire and blood."" Jon is upset by the notion that blood defines who they are, saying Daenerys is not her father as Tyrion is not his father. Tyrion admits that Tywin and Cersei were both evil, but reminds Jon that Daenerys has killed more people than Tywin, Cersei and any of the evil people they know. Jon tries to defend Daenerys, going over her various traumas (Missandei\'s murder, Rhaegal\'s death) and Cersei\'s actions, but Tyrion reminds Jon, ""And she burned down a city for it."" He forces Jon to pause when he asks, ""Would you have done it?""; he\xa0tries to make Jon see that, if he had been in the same place, knowing what it\'s like to be on dragonback with that power, Jon wouldn\'t have done the same thing. Tyrion realizes Jon doesn\'t want to betray Daenerys. He goes over Daenerys\'s history of killing evil men, and how everyone supported her for it, but she grew more and more powerful, more convinced of her rightness.

Tyrion agrees and says that sometimes, duty must be the death of love, ""You are the shield that guards the realms of men. You\'ve already tried to do the right thing, no matter the cost. You\'ve tried to protect the people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"" Tyrion acknowledges assassinating Daenerys is a terrible thing he\'s asking Jon to do, but says it\'s also the right thing. As Jon struggles with the idea of killing the woman he\xa0loves, Tyrion says he won\'t be the last man she executes and asks,\xa0""Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?"" Jon accepts being executed by Daenerys if that is her choice. He apologizes to Tyrion that it came to this, but Tyrion tries again, ""And your sisters? Do you see them bending their knee?"" Jon says his sisters will be loyal to the throne, but Tyrion responds that the reason Sansa told him about Jon\'s parentage is because she doesn\'t want Daenerys to be queen. Jon says that\'s not up to Sansa;\xa0Tyrion agrees, but tells Jon he needs to make a choice, ""And you have to choose now.""

Daenerys tells him that when she was a child,\xa0her brother would tell her that it was made from the thousand swords of Aegon\'s fallen enemies, ""What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can\'t count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon\'s feet."" Jon confronts her over Grey Worm executing the Lannister prisoners in the streets but Daenerys defends it is necessary. Jon protests, ""Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children! Little children, burned!"" Daenerys says she tried to make peace with Cersei, but she used their innocence against her, ""She thought it would cripple me.""\xa0Jon urges her to forgive Tyrion and the people of King\'s Landing, who she\'s ordered to be executed. He pleads with Daenerys to make them see they made a mistake, make them understand she isn\'t this person, ""Please, Dany."" However, Daenerys says she can\'t and is resolved, ""We can\'t give in to small mercies,"" she rallies. Jon urges her that they need a world of mercy, but Daenerys tries to convince Jon that her way is the way to the better world. A distressed Jon asks her how she knows, and Daenerys assures him it\'s because she knows what is good and gently tells him that so does he. Jon tearfully says he doesn\'t know and asks, ""What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what\'s good?"" Daenerys simply replies, ""They don\'t get to choose."" Daenerys embraces Jon and, sincere, she tells him to join her and that she wants him to help her break the wheel, trying to convince him of her new vision. Heartbroken, Jon declares, ""You are my queen, now and always."" They kiss and as they do so, an anguished Jon drives his dagger through her heart. Stunned, Daenerys collapses as Jon catches her.

Remarking on Joffrey's horrible nature, Olenna proudly admits that she enacted measures to protect her family at all costs, with no regrets, but reflects that her actions pale in comparison to the atrocities performed by Cersei. She tells Jaime that Cersei is a monster; a matter of opinion according to Jaime. While some may dread her, Jaime insists that none will care what she has done, so long as order is restored. Olenna observes that Jaime really does love his sister, and calls him a fool, claiming that she will be the end of him, and that by the time he realizes what a disease Cersei is, it will be far too late for him. Jaime considers this a moot point, of little value discussing with Olenna, although she points out that as an experienced person about to die, she is the perfect person to discuss his life with.\n"", 'Olenna again asks Jaime how he plans to kill her. Jaime tells her of Cersei’s idea of having her whipped and beheaded, or flayed alive and hanged, but he talked her out of those ideas. He then produces a small vial and empties its contents into one of the glasses of wine, giving it to Olenna who then drinks it after Jaime confirms that it will be a painless death. Olenna reflects on the horrible way that Joffrey died, and the gruesome details that the poison caused; she admits that part was unintentional on her part, as she had never seen the strangler work in person before. Shocked into silence, Jaime stares at her, realizing at last who really killed his eldest son and let his brother take the blame, setting in motion the deaths of Oberyn Martell and Tywin Lannister.

Apparently hoping to exploit disunity among the Stark children, he tries to ingratiate himself with Bran,\xa0Ned Stark\'s last trueborn son and rightful heir to Winterfell. Littlefinger gives Bran a gift, the very same Valyrian steel dagger that a cutthroat tried to kill him with while he was in a coma right after he was pushed from one of Winterfell\'s towers. Bran is still emotionally detached, however, from all of his visions as the new Three-Eyed Raven, and is generally uninterested, only absentmindedly asking who the dagger belonged to. With a wry look, Littlefinger responds that, in a way, this is the question which started the entire War of the Five Kings. Bran\'s mother Catelyn Stark took the dagger south with her to King\'s Landing to try to find who it belonged to, convinced the Lannisters sent the cutthroat to kill Bran (and left it there in Ned\'s possession, from whom Littlefinger recovered it). Littlefinger tries to manipulate Bran by remarking on how much chaos he must have lived through to get back to Winterfell. In response, Bran looks at Littlefinger and says, ""Chaos is a ladder,"" quoting back Littlefinger\'s own words to him, which Littlefinger said to Varys in King\'s Landing years before and which Bran couldn\'t possibly have been physically present to hear himself. Visibly unnerved, Littlefinger is startled by Meera Reed entering the room. He takes his leave of Bran, calling him ""Lord Stark"", though again Bran insists he\'s not a Lord.\n', 'After Littlefinger leaves, Meera notices Bran\'s new wheelchair. He explains Maester Wolkan built it for him. She tells him that she has come to tell him she\'s leaving and say goodbye; she promised to keep him safe, and now that he\'s back in Winterfell surrounded by his Stark forces, he\'s as safe as anyone will be before the coming war. Meera explains that when the White Walkers arrive, she wants to be with her family, so she is heading back to the Neck to assist the Crannogmen. She says he doesn\'t need her in Winterfell anymore; Bran agrees with her and with blank emotional affect, simply thanking her for her help. Meera becomes angry that this is all he has to say after everything they went through, when Hodor and Summer and even her own brother Jojen died for Bran. Bran responds that he isn\'t really ""Bran Stark"" anymore, but the Three-Eyed Raven. He ""remembers"" the events of Bran Stark\'s life, but now ""remembers"" vast amounts of other accumulated memories from centuries upon centuries. Everything that once affected ""Bran Stark"" now seems distant and trivial to him. In horror, Meera cries that he ""died"" in the cave and leaves.\n', 'Meanwhile, Arya Stark finally returns to Winterfell, after leaving years before with her father, Sansa, and King Robert Baratheon\'s entourage, right after Bran\'s fall from the tower. Arya rides up to the gates and dismounts, but the guards don\'t believe her when she says she is in fact Arya Stark, convinced that Arya has been dead for years. Arya asks that they send word to Maester Luwin and Rodrik Cassel, hoping either can prove her identity but unaware they are both dead. The guards gruffly say that no one by those names is there, so Arya asks for Jon. The two say he\'d just left Winterfell. Arya asks who is in charge of Winterfell then, and they say ""Lady Stark"" (who Arya realizes is her sister). They try to brush her aside, but she dodges them with her assassin\'s reflexes, and insists that one way or another, she\'s getting in. She explains to them that if she is Arya, they\'ll be in a lot of trouble for turning her away, and if she isn\'t, she won\'t last long in Winterfell anyway. Mildly concerned, they agree to at least let her in the courtyard but insist that she stay put while they consult Sansa so they can disprove her identity. As soon as they take their eyes off her, however, she slips away. The two guards go to inform Sansa and try to wave it aside as just some impostor, but when they mention she asked for Luwin and Cassel, she instantly realizes it must be Arya, and already knows where she has gone.\n', 'Sansa finds Arya where she expected, in the crypts looking over their father Ned\'s grave. They are happy to see each other but so much has happened to both of them in the past few years that they are at first awkward, unsure of what to say. Arya asks if she has to call Sansa ""Lady Stark"" now, to which Sansa firmly insists yes, and laughs. They smile and hug, though still a bit unsure. Arya notes that Jon left her in charge and smiles when Sansa says that she hopes Jon will be back soon. He will be both surprised and happy to see Arya, Sansa remembering how happy Jon was to see her when they were reunited. The sisters then look sadly on their father\'s grave statue. Arya says it doesn\'t really look like him. Sansa acknowledges that everyone who knew his face well is dead. Arya points out they\'re not.\n', 'Arya then asks if Sansa killed Joffrey as everyone believes. She explains she actually didn\'t, though she wished she had. Arya remarks that he was always at the top of her ""list"". This confuses Sansa, and Arya explains that she\'d been keeping a list of everyone she was going to kill, at which they both laugh. Finally, Sansa asks how Arya got back, but she only says her road wasn\'t a pleasant one. Sansa says hers wasn\'t either. They hug again, earnestly and warmly. Sansa then informs Arya that Bran is home too. Arya is elated, but her face falls when Sansa makes no mention of Rickon, immediately realizing that Rickon is dead.\n', 'Sansa brings Arya to Bran in the Godswood, where he is lost in thought by the Weirwood heart tree. Arya is saddened to see him so paralyzed. Still somewhat detached even at the sight of Arya, he says he isn\'t surprised she\'s alive because he saw her at the Crossroads. Arya is confused, and Sansa explains that Bran is having ""visions"" now. Bran says he thought Arya was going to King\'s Landing, and when Sansa asks why she would head there of all places, he again startles them both by saying it\'s because Cersei is on her list of names (which he can\'t possibly be aware of through normal means). Sansa asks who else is on her list, but she says most of them besides Cersei are actually dead already.\n', ""They then remark on the Valyrian steel dagger in his lap, and he explains that Littlefinger gave it to him, thinking he'd want it. Despite it being such a horrible keepsake that nearly killed him and indirectly set off a chain of events leading to his parents' deaths, he is still listless and disinterested in it. Arya is confused as to why a common cutthroat would have a rare, priceless blade of Valyrian steel. Bran matter-of-factly says that someone very wealthy wanted him dead, and gave it to the assassin. Sansa acknowledges she doesn't actually trust Littlefinger and he'd never give anyone anything unless expecting something in return.\n"", ""Ned and Catelyn Stark's surviving children are reunited."", 'Bran says that doesn\'t matter, because he doesn\'t even want it. Instead, Bran hands it to Arya and says she can have it, saying the dagger would be ""wasted on a cripple"".

Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne see them from afar, all three of Catelyn Stark\'s surviving children reunited. Pod says Catelyn would be proud of Brienne, but she chides that she did next to nothing. Pod says he disagrees with ""my lady"", and Brienne starts to correct him that she doesn\'t consider herself a ""lady"", but then stops halfway and just thanks him for the compliment.\n', 'Some time later, Brienne is going through a vigorous sword practice session with Podrick, knocking him down when he overextends himself. Impressed, Arya interrupts and says she\'d like to spar with Brienne, the woman who beat the Hound in combat. Sansa and Littlefinger watch on silently from the walkway above. Brienne goes easy on her at first, but then Arya completely outmaneuvers Brienne using the Water Dance training she received from Syrio Forel, augmented by her training with the Faceless Men. Arya achieves many openings that would be a killing blow if she wanted them to be. Surprised that such a young girl is so skilled, Brienne stops holding back, leading to a more grueling sparring session. Brienne actually manages to knock Needle out of Arya\'s hand but she simply switches to the Valyrian steel dagger she had in her belt. Arya uses her speed and agility to compensate for Brienne\'s strength and size to overwhelm her - until Brienne actually manages to bring her brute strength to bear on a fast moving target by landing a kick on Arya\'s chest that sends her falling down. Ultimately, they reach a stalemate, with each of them holding a blade at the others\' throat. Brienne asks Arya who taught her to fight like that, and she simply responds, ""no one"". Arya takes her leave of Brienne, both mutually impressed, as Sansa looks down baffled and concerned at how her sister reached such a deadly skill level. Arya herself then glares at an equally surprised Littlefinger.\n']"

Daenerys asks what happened between her and Grey Worm, and Missandei wryly says ""many things"", smiling. Jon then leads Daenerys on a tour of the long-abandoned Valyrian dragonglass mine that Samwell Tarly told him about. The mine is ancient and impressive, used by the First Men long before the Valyrians came to Dragonstone. But this is not why Jon asked Daenerys to come.\n', ""As they proceed deeper into the mines led by torchlight, Jon shows her cave paintings they discovered left behind by the Children of the Forest, filled with arcane magical symbols. Daenerys is stunned that the mythical Children stood where they are standing now, thousands upon thousands of years ago, long before mankind ever arrived in Westeros. Jon says this isn't exactly true, leading her into another chamber, this one filled with narrative drawings of the Children and the First Men. Daenerys wonders if the Children and First Men fought each other, but Jon then shows her ancient carvings of the White Walkers themselves, one of which Jon recognizes as an image of the Night King. Jon explains that the Children of the Forest and the First Men only managed to drive off the White Walkers the first time during the Long Night because they chose to join together to fight off their own extinction, and that is the choice between Jon and Daenerys now.\n"", ""Jon asks Daenerys to ally with him to defeat the Night King.

They inform her that the Unsullied succeeded in capturing Casterly Rock, only to then reveal the disaster which just occurred at Highgarden as Tyrion\'s military strategy fell apart. Casterly Rock was only a feint and the Lannisters didn\'t bother defending it, in order to make a surprise attack south which sacked Highgarden. Daenerys is furious and struggles to keep her temper, as now all three of her major allies in Westeros are gone and all she has gained is a castle with no supplies. She snaps at Tyrion, blaming his cautious strategy for losing them Dorne, the Iron Islands (Yara\'s forces), and now the Reach. She then accuses Tyrion of wanting to use a light hand against the Lannisters because they\'re his own people. Tyrion insists that they still have just enough ships left to at least shuttle the Dothraki from Dragonstone to the nearby mainland coast; even with the loss of all her other allies, her combined Unsullied/Dothraki forces are still the largest single army in Westeros. Daenerys fumes that her vast numbers are useless if she can\'t feed them all, as that was the Reach\'s true strategic value. Daenerys decides she has had enough of clever plans, and will use the Dothraki and her dragons in a direct assault to turn the tide of the war back in her favor. She desires to assault the Red Keep with all three of her dragons, intending to raze it to the ground with all her enemies inside it, but Jon argues against such a course of action when she asks him his opinion; by bringing dragons back to life and breaking the back of the slave trade, Daenerys has proven she might be capable of doing things differently. However, if she uses her dragons to ""melt castles and burn cities"", she will be no different from any of the more tyrannical of her Targaryen ancestors who came before her.\n', 'Later, Jon and Davos Seaworth proceed back up to the castle. Davos remarks that Jon seems attracted to Daenerys. Jon says Daenerys has a good heart but brushes Davos\' observation aside, saying he doesn\'t ""have time for that"" as he has seen the Night King and his horde of the undead.

Jon explains that because his parents weren\'t married, he is bastard-born as a result and uses the regional surname \'Snow\' - the name reserved for highborn Northern bastards of nobility. Davos asks Missandei if they have similar customs for bastards on Naath, Missandei\'s birthplace. Missandei explains that ""Marriage"" as such does not exist in Naath, so she finds the idea of a ""bastard"" to be quite an alien concept. Davos remarks that it sounds liberating. He then asks why she left, to which Missandei finally reveals that she was taken by slavers, to be freed only years later by Daenerys. When Davos suggests Missandei simply traded one master for another, she counters that she and all the freed slaves serve Daenerys because they choose to.

Since then, Theon had betrayed House Stark, a factor (albeit not the only one) that nearly destroyed House Stark and contributed to the deaths of two of Jon's half-brothers, Robb and Rickon. Jon is stunned for a moment as well. Theon walks up to Jon and asks him if Sansa, Jon's half-sister, is all right. A furious Jon angrily grabs Theon by his coat and shakes him, remembering Theon's past treachery. Jon tells Theon that what he did to save Sansa is the only reason that he is not killing him on the spot and releases him.
